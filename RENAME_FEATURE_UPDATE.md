# Enhanced File Renaming Feature - Update Summary

## 🎯 What Was Improved

The file renaming feature has been **significantly enhanced** to be more reliable and robust.

## ✅ New Improvements

### 1. Smart Download Detection

- **Before**: Fixed 10-second wait
- **After**: Intelligent waiting up to 30 seconds
  - Actively monitors the download folder
  - Waits for the file to appear
  - Continues checking until file is found or timeout

### 2. Download Completion Verification

- **New Feature**: File size stability check
  - Checks file size twice (2 seconds apart)
  - Only renames when file size is stable
  - Ensures download is 100% complete before renaming

### 3. Duplicate File Handling

- **New Feature**: Auto-increment counter
  - If `NIFTY500_20251001_1015min.csv` exists
  - Creates `NIFTY500_20251001_1015min_1.csv`
  - Next: `NIFTY500_20251001_1015min_2.csv`
  - Prevents overwriting existing files

### 4. Improved File Detection

- **Enhancement**: Only looks for new downloads
  - Ignores already-renamed files (starting with "NIFTY500\_")
  - Finds only the original downloaded file
  - Prevents renaming the same file multiple times

### 5. Better User Feedback

- **Updated Messages**:
  - "Download initiated..." (instead of "completed")
  - Shows actual renamed filename in status
  - Clearer log messages

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### Code Enhancements

```python
# Old approach
time.sleep(10)
self.rename_downloaded_file()

# New approach
time.sleep(3)  # Just wait for download to start
self.rename_downloaded_file()  # Will intelligently wait for completion
```

### Smart Waiting Logic

```python
# Wait for file to appear (up to 30 seconds)
while wait_count < max_wait:
    files = [f for f in os.listdir(path) if f.endswith('.csv') and not f.startswith('NIFTY500_')]

    # Check if file size is stable
    size1 = os.path.getsize(file)
    time.sleep(2)
    size2 = os.path.getsize(file)

    if size1 == size2 and size1 > 0:
        break  # Download complete!
```

## 📊 Performance Impact

- **Faster for quick downloads**: No unnecessary 10-second wait
- **More reliable for slow downloads**: Waits up to 30 seconds if needed
- **No data loss**: Ensures file is fully downloaded before renaming

## 🎯 Use Cases Now Supported

1. ✅ **Multiple downloads in same minute** → Auto-incrementing counter
2. ✅ **Slow internet connections** → Extended wait time
3. ✅ **Fast downloads** → No unnecessary waiting
4. ✅ **Interrupted downloads** → Proper error handling
5. ✅ **Re-running downloads** → Doesn't rename old files

## 📝 Updated Files

1. **nse_downloader.py** - Enhanced `rename_downloaded_file()` method
2. **FILE_NAMING.md** - Updated documentation with new features

## 🚀 Testing Recommendation

Test the enhanced feature by:

1. Running manual download: Click "Download Now"
2. Check the status messages
3. Verify file is renamed correctly
4. Try downloading again in the same minute (should create `_1` version)

## Example Output

```
[2025-10-01 10:15:23] Starting download...
[2025-10-01 10:15:30] Download initiated...
[2025-10-01 10:15:35] File saved as: NIFTY500_20251001_1015min.csv
```
