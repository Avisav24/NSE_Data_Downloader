# Multiple Schedule Times Feature

## Overview

You can now schedule downloads at **multiple times** throughout the day! This allows you to capture NIFTY 500 data at different market hours automatically.

## How to Use

### Setting Multiple Times

In the "Schedule Times" section of the GUI:

1. Enter times separated by commas
2. Use 24-hour format (HH:MM)
3. Click "Start Scheduler"

### Example Inputs

```
09:30, 12:00, 15:30
```

This will download data at:

- 9:30 AM (market open)
- 12:00 PM (midday)
- 3:30 PM (market close)

### More Examples

**Hourly during market hours:**

```
09:30, 10:30, 11:30, 12:30, 13:30, 14:30, 15:30
```

**Key market moments:**

```
09:15, 15:30
```

**Single time (still works):**

```
09:30
```

## Features

## Usage Tips

### Best Practices

1. **Market Hours**: NSE is open 9:15 AM to 3:30 PM
2. **Avoid Too Frequent**: Don't schedule every minute (website limits)
3. **Key Times**: Focus on market open, midday, and close
4. **Test First**: Try manual download before scheduling

### Recommended Schedules

**Conservative (3 downloads/day):**

```
09:30, 12:00, 15:30
```

**Active Trader (6 downloads/day):**

```
09:30, 10:30, 11:30, 12:30, 14:00, 15:30
```

**Quick Check (1 download/day):**

```
15:35
```

## Troubleshooting

### Invalid Time Format

- ‚ùå Wrong: `9:30` (missing leading zero)
- ‚úÖ Correct: `09:30`
- ‚ùå Wrong: `09:30,12:00` (no space after comma is fine, but ensure commas separate)
- ‚úÖ Correct: `09:30, 12:00` or `09:30,12:00`
